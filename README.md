Hello world! This repo is meant to demonstrate my first game jam project that I completed with a friend of mine. We collaberativly designed the game, with my friend doing level design and myself doing the programming.  If you're curious about the work that I have done on this project. Simply click on UE_GMTK -> Source -> MyProject. From there you will find all of the C++ code that I did for the project. I also have Blueprints that I programmed inside of the content folder.
